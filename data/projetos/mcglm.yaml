  Multivariate covariance generalized linear models. `mcglm` fits
  multivariate covariance generalized linear models. It allows using a
  different linear predictor for each response variable of a
  multivariate response vector. The response variable can be continous
  or dicrete, like counts and binary and also limited continuos ou
  discrete/continuous inflated responses. The most important and
  relevant feature is that many covariance structures can be used to
  model the relations among variables.  <br>**Project owner**: Wagner
